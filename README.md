Description: This repository provides data and scripts to analyze the influence of ocean acidification on juvenile geoduck phenotype and DNA methylation. Geoduck (X days old) were exposed to 3 differnt pH conditions for 23 days, placed in a common garden tank for 28 days at ambient pH, then in an outdoor common garden for X days and finally re-exposed to different pH treatments for X days. Performance was assessed via growth and survivorship and samples were collected for DNA methylation analyses to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation may account for differences in phenotype observed following treatment.
